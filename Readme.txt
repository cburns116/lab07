I decided to follow the same steps I did for lab 1 to set up the .htaccess file using the <virtualhost> tag

I formulated proper xml by following lab 2 and created nice tags that were easy to read and follow

I created my ajax function that hypothetically works using my knowledge of get requests and data type being xml. The problem I ran into was the fact I was not retriving from the server when I made my get request. I was trying to grab the information from the server but ran out of time to change the links. In the console log I added a part to spit out the issue. 

Overall I think all of the pieces are there just the fact my function can not locate the xml is the only issue and it should display that in the id=displaydata. this occurs automatically thanks to my onload function in AJAX(ready).
