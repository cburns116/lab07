This is Corey Burns' readme file:

Sources: 
For the project I used jquery ui (https://jqueryui.com/) to implement the accordion style along with tool tip to create a classy hover over giving a further description to what you are about to click on.

I also used bootstrap to create a very decrative header showing the purpose of the page. This is dynamic and will not effect the website if the page is resized. I also used bootstrap to add a progress bar to show how much of the class I have done. I thought this was an excelent touch. I used http://www.w3schools.com/bootstrap/ to help me out.

Lab:

For this lab I used git to create a repo and upload my files. I then used my knowledge of creating virtual host and made my whole lab 7 be the homepage for my website. This made it very easy to use the command line to make commits and pushes for git. 

As far as improving the website, I started by adding the accordion jquery ui edit to display the labs. To implement this I had to edit the way my js put the xml data into the html making sure the correct struecture was used.

Another edit was to add tooltip. To use this jquery ui I added a title tag in my js to display "this is the solution to lab:"

After these I added some bootstrap, first being a header that is dynamically adjusted so no matter what size the page, the page will not be effected. I used this theme to have "Web Systems: Labs and Homeworks" at the top followed by the "Created by Corey Burns"

The last huge addition I made was adding a great adimated progress bar that showed I was 70 percent done with the class. After every lab I am going to update this. This was a great touch and pulled the whole website together.
